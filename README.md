[Article: What Does a Software Engineer Do?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer)

I thought this article was interesting because they talk about the day to day tasks of what software engineers do. I like that there are many resources related to software engineering, such as how to become a SWE, certifications, and other useful information such as different career paths. 

**Hojong Shim**: Thank you for your insight! I think this was a very useful guide on what software engineering is really like -- I will also keep these tips in mind for the future.
