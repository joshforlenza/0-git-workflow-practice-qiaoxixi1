[Article: What Does a Software Engineer Do?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer)

I thought this article was interesting because they talk about the day to day tasks of what software engineers do. I like that there are many resources related to software engineering, such as how to become a SWE, certifications, and other useful information such as different career paths.
